This code is in Perl. It can be used to count occurances of a string in a text-file (also arabic). It's tested in Linux (Mint). When running the code, there are two arguments that's needed: the filename (in same folder) and the search-term.
Also to search for arabic text, you must have arabic enabled as a keyboard language.
